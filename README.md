# SQL-E-Commerce
Using SQL to extract and analyze key e-commerce and user behavior metrics from Google Analytics sample data. It covers traffic performance, conversion funnels, revenue breakdowns, and cohort analysis across various timeframes and dimensions. The queries are designed to support data-driven insights into user engagement and purchasing behavior.

## Problem Solving

### Query 01: calculate total visit, pageview, transaction for Jan, Feb, and March 2017 (order by month)
```
SELECT 
      FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m', PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date)) AS month,
      COUNT(totals.visits) as visits,
      COUNT(totals.pageviews) as pageviews,
      COUNT(totals.transactions) as transactions    
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`
WHERE _table_suffix between '0101' and '0331'
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```
![Result](Images/Query1.png)

Insights:
- January 2017 saw 64,694 visits, 64,691 pageviews, and 697 transactions, indicating a solid start to the year with consistent engagement and conversion.
- February 2017 recorded a slight dip with 62,192 visits, 62,185 pageviews, but a modest rise in transactions to 708, suggesting improved purchase efficiency.
- March 2017 showed strong growth across all metrics, reaching 69,931 visits, 69,927 pageviews, and 883 transactions, marking it as the highest-performing month in Q1.

### Query 02: Bounce rate per traffic source in July 2017 (Bounce_rate = num_bounce/total_visit) (order by total_visit DESC)
```
SELECT
    trafficSource.source as source,
    sum(totals.visits) as total_visits,
    sum(totals.Bounces) as total_no_of_bounces,
    (sum(totals.Bounces)/sum(totals.visits))* 100.00 as bounce_rate
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*`
GROUP BY source
ORDER BY total_visits DESC;
```
![Result](Images/Query2.png)

Insights:
- Google was the top traffic source by volume, with over 38,000 visits and a moderate bounce rate of 51.57%, indicating average session quality.
- YouTube.com, despite being the third-largest source, had a high bounce rate of 66.72%, suggesting users may not have found what they expected or left quickly.
- Direct traffic performed better with a lower bounce rate of 43.27%, implying stronger intent or familiarity with the site.
- m.facebook.com and bing had the highest bounce rates (64.27% and 63.64%, respectively), pointing to weaker engagement or mismatched targeting.
- Smaller sources like dfa, sites.google.com, and google.com showed relatively low bounce rates, possibly reflecting more qualified or niche traffic.

### Query 3: Revenue by traffic source by week, by month in June 2017
```
WITH month_revenue AS
      (SELECT
        'Month' AS time_type,
        FORMAT_DATE('%Y-%m', PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date)) AS time,
        trafficSource.source AS source,
        round(SUM(product.productRevenue) / 1000000,4) AS revenue
      FROM
        `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201706*`,
        UNNEST(hits) AS hits,
        UNNEST(hits.product) AS product
      WHERE
        product.productRevenue IS NOT NULL
      GROUP BY
        source,
        time 
      ORDER BY source
      ),

  weekly_revenue AS (
    SELECT
      'Week' AS time_type,
      CASE EXTRACT(ISOWEEK FROM PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date))
        WHEN 22 THEN "Week 1" --Date from 1st to 4th--
        WHEN 23 THEN "Week 2" --Date from 5th to 11th--
        WHEN 24 THEN "Week 3" --Date from 12th to 18th--
        WHEN 25 THEN "Week 4" --Date from 19th to 25th--
        WHEN 26 THEN "Week 5" --The rest--
        ELSE NULL
      END AS week_number,
      trafficSource.source AS source,
      ROUND(SUM(product.productRevenue) / 1000000, 4) AS revenue
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201706*`,
      UNNEST(hits) AS hits,
      UNNEST(hits.product) AS product
    WHERE
      product.productRevenue IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY
      week_number, source, time_type
    ORDER BY source
  )


  SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT * FROM month_revenue
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM weekly_revenue
)
ORDER BY
  source,
  revenue DESC,
  time_type;

```

![Result](Images/Query3.png)

Logical Explanation:
June 2017 doesn’t start on a Monday, so using ISO week numbers (22–26) allows for consistent weekly grouping:
- Week 1 (June 1–4): Captures the partial start of the month
- Week 2 (June 5–11)
- Week 3 (June 12–18)
- Week 4 (June 19–25)
- Week 5 (June 26–30): Captures the final partial week
This segmentation ensures:
- Logical grouping of user behavior and revenue trends
- Avoids splitting weeks across months, which can distort performance analysis
- Aligns with business reporting cycles, especially for marketing and campaign tracking

Insights:
- (direct) traffic was the dominant revenue source, contributing over $97K, with a strong upward trend from Week 1 to Week 4. This suggests an increase in user intent or successful campaign momentum.
- dfa showed volatile performance, with revenue peaking in Week 5 ($3.7K) and Week 3 ($2.3K), but dropping to zero in Week 4, indicating inconsistent engagement or campaign pacing.
- chat.google.com and bing contributed minor revenue, likely from niche referrals or isolated user actions.

### Query 04: Average number of pageviews by purchaser type (purchasers vs non-purchasers) in June, July 2017.
```
WITH purchased_pageviews AS (
  SELECT 
    FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m', PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date)) AS month,
    SUM(totals.pageviews) / COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS avg_pageviews_purchase
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`,
    UNNEST(hits) AS hits,
    UNNEST(hits.product) AS product
  WHERE 
    totals.transactions >= 1
    AND product.productRevenue IS NOT NULL
    AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date)) IN (6, 7)
    AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date)) = 2017
  GROUP BY month
),
nonpurchased_pageviews AS (
  SELECT 
    FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m', PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date)) AS month,
    SUM(totals.pageviews) / COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS avg_pageviews_non_purchase
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`,
    UNNEST(hits) AS hits,
    UNNEST(hits.product) AS product
  WHERE 
    totals.transactions IS NULL
    AND product.productRevenue IS NULL
    AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date)) IN (6, 7)
    AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date)) = 2017
  GROUP BY month
)
SELECT 
  p.month AS month,
  p.avg_pageviews_purchase,
  n.avg_pageviews_non_purchase
FROM purchased_pageviews AS p
FULL JOIN nonpurchased_pageviews AS n
  ON p.month = n.month
ORDER BY p.month;
```
![Result](Images/Query4.png)

Insights:
- Non-purchasers consistently viewed more pages than purchasers in both months — over 3x more on average. This could indicate browsing behavior without strong purchase intent, or friction in the conversion funnel.
- Purchasers showed increased engagement in July, with average pageviews rising from 94 to 124, suggesting deeper product exploration or more complex decision-making.
- The gap between purchasers and non-purchasers widened slightly in July, reinforcing the need to understand what prevents high-engagement users from converting.

### Query 05: Average number of transactions per user that purchased in July 2017
```
SELECT
  FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m', PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date)) AS month,

FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*`,
  UNNEST(hits) AS hits,
  UNNEST(hits.product) AS product
WHERE
    totals.transactions >=1
    and productRevenue is not null
GROUP BY month;
```
![Result](Images/Query5.png)

Insights: 
-In July 2017, the average total transaction by user was 4.14

### Query 06: Average amount of money spent per session. Only include purchaser data in July 2017
```
SELECT
  FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m', PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date)) AS month,
  (SUM(product.productRevenue) / SUM(totals.visits))/1000000 AS avg_revenue_by_user_per_visit
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*`,
  UNNEST(hits) AS hits,
  UNNEST(hits.product) AS product
WHERE
  totals.transactions >= 1
  AND product.productRevenue IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY month;
```
![Result](Images/Query6.png)

Insights:
In July 2017, the average revenue by user per visit was $43.85

ORDER BY quantity DESC;

```
![Result](Images/Query7.png)

Insights:
- Customers who purchased the YouTube Men's Vintage Henley tended to buy a diverse mix of branded lifestyle products, including apparel, accessories, and novelty items.
- The top co-purchased item was Google Sunglasses (20 units), suggesting strong interest in stylish, recognizable merchandise.
